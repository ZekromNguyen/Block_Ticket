# Approval Workflows & Dual-Control Feature

## Overview

The Approval Workflows feature implements comprehensive dual-control mechanisms for sensitive operations within the Event Service. This enterprise-grade solution ensures proper governance, security, and compliance for critical business operations through mandatory approvals from authorized personnel.

## Features

### Core Functionality

#### üîê Dual-Control Security
- **Multi-Approver Requirements**: Configurable 1-N approvals based on operation risk
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Restrict approvals to specific organizational roles
- **Sequential/Parallel Approval**: Flexible approval workflows
- **Approval Segregation**: Prevent self-approval and enforce independence

#### üìã Operation Coverage
- **Event Operations**: Publish, cancel, price changes, date modifications
- **Venue Operations**: Modifications, deactivations, seat map changes
- **Financial Operations**: Bulk refunds, pricing rule changes
- **Administrative Operations**: Security role changes, data exports
- **Compliance Operations**: Administrative overrides, reservation overrides

#### ‚ö° Intelligent Processing
- **Auto-Approval**: Low-risk operations with configurable conditions
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level determination
- **Escalation Management**: Time-based escalation to senior roles
- **Expiration Handling**: Automatic workflow expiration with cleanup

#### üìä Comprehensive Auditing
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every action, decision, and modification logged
- **Security Context**: IP addresses, user agents, timestamps recorded
- **Compliance Reporting**: Full audit history for regulatory requirements
- **Decision Tracking**: Detailed approval/rejection reasoning

### Workflow States

#### Workflow Lifecycle
```
Draft ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Approved/Rejected/Expired
```

#### State Transitions
- **Pending**: Initial state waiting for approvers
- **Under Review**: Partial approvals received, waiting for more
- **Approved**: All required approvals received, ready for execution
- **Rejected**: Any approver rejected, workflow terminated
- **Expired**: Exceeded time limit without completion
- **Cancelled**: Manually cancelled by requester or admin

### Risk-Based Controls

#### Risk Levels
- **Low**: Auto-approval eligible, single approval required
- **Medium**: Standard dual approval, moderate escalation
- **High**: Enhanced approval requirements, rapid escalation
- **Critical**: Maximum approvals, immediate escalation

#### Dynamic Risk Assessment
- **Operation Type**: Inherent risk based on operation category
- **Impact Analysis**: Financial and operational impact evaluation
- **Timing Constraints**: Time-sensitive operations get priority
- **Historical Context**: Previous approval patterns consideration

## Integration Points

### Event Operations
```csharp
// Before publishing an event
var requiresApproval = await _approvalService.RequiresApprovalAsync(
    ApprovalOperationType.EventPublish, organizationId);

if (requiresApproval)
{
    var workflowRequest = new CreateApprovalWorkflowRequest
    {
        OperationType = ApprovalOperationType.EventPublish,
        EntityType = "Event",
        EntityId = eventId,
        OperationDescription = "Publish concert event",
        BusinessJustification = "Marketing campaign launch",
        OperationData = publishRequest
    };
    
    var result = await _approvalService.CreateWorkflowAsync(
        workflowRequest, userId, organizationId);
    
    return AcceptedAt("GetWorkflow", new { id = result.WorkflowId });
}

// Direct execution for non-approval operations
await ExecuteEventPublishAsync(eventId);
```

### Validation Integration
```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> CreatePricingRule(CreatePricingRuleRequest request)
{
    // Validate operation before creating approval workflow
    var validation = await _operationExecutor.ValidateOperationAsync(
        ApprovalOperationType.PricingRuleCreation,
        "PricingRule",
        Guid.Empty,
        request);
    
    if (!validation.IsValid)
    {
        return BadRequest(validation.ValidationErrors);
    }
    
    // Create approval workflow
    return await CreateApprovalWorkflow(request);
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- **Insufficient Permissions**: User lacks approval rights for operation
- **Duplicate Workflows**: Entity already has pending approval
- **Expired Sessions**: Approval session timeout handling
- **Validation Failures**: Operation data validation errors
- **Template Missing**: No approval template configured for operation

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "title": "Approval workflow creation failed",
  "detail": "There are already pending approval workflows for this entity",
  "status": 409,
  "type": "https://api.eventservice.com/errors/duplicate-workflow",
  "instance": "/api/v1/approvals",
  "extensions": {
    "workflowId": "existing-workflow-id",
    "entityType": "Event",
    "entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Template Design
1. **Risk-Appropriate Controls**: Match approval requirements to actual risk
2. **Clear Descriptions**: Provide detailed operation descriptions
3. **Reasonable Timeframes**: Set realistic expiration times
4. **Escalation Planning**: Define clear escalation paths
5. **Auto-Approval Criteria**: Use for low-risk, routine operations

### Operational Guidelines
1. **Timely Reviews**: Encourage prompt approval decisions
2. **Detailed Justifications**: Require comprehensive business reasons
3. **Regular Audits**: Review approval patterns and effectiveness
4. **Template Maintenance**: Keep approval templates current
5. **Training Programs**: Ensure approvers understand responsibilities

### Security Considerations
1. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary approval rights
2. **Regular Reviews**: Audit approver permissions quarterly
3. **Segregation Enforcement**: Prevent conflicts of interest
4. **Audit Retention**: Maintain audit logs per compliance requirements
5. **Incident Response**: Have procedures for approval system breaches

## Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast approval bottlenecks and delays
- **Mobile Approval App**: Native mobile application for approvers
- **Integration APIs**: Enhanced third-party system integration
